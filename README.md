## Introduction

In this era of internet, we can easily reach latest news which we could improve our skills and knowledge, but at the same time we could also absorbe tones of negative information such as someone else been sucsessful and becoming negative about it. 

This could impact anyone negativly which could lead to demotivation in learning. This habbit of feeling negative when seeing someone else sucsessful comes from the habit of comparing yourself with others. This habbit of comparing with others are been reserched in many studies such as [_Facebook’s emotional consequences_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214001241) and tones of media such as blogs and youtube video's are introducing this problem. 

As a conclusion for this problem, comparing your financial or educational result to your past self have been very effective in majority of population including myself. However, without numerical result such as test result and annual income, it can be really difficult to visualise your improvement in studying.

To make this **visualization of improvement** clear, I have decided to develope an application which compares consumers result with past result by using mathematical method Z score. 

When comparing data with several data, simple difference from the mean would not tell you much. In statistics, two significant features in dataset, mean and standard diviation will tell us clear information about the new data compared to the dataset. In order to clearly show the two features, using the Z score would be the best option assuming that the dataset follow the normal distribution. 

### points to be improve

・It can be difficult to collect decent amount of data in order to get accurate Z score. 

・users get absolutely no information about the first two data 

・only datatype is time (hours and seconds)

・users have to manuary input their own data
