## Why

In this era of internet, we can easily reach latest news which we could improve our skills and knowledge, but at the same time we could also absorbe tones of negative information such as someone else been sucsessful and becoming negative about it. 
This could impact anyone negativly which could lead to demotivation in learning. This habbit of feeling negative when seeing someone else sucsessful comes from the habit of comparing yourself with others.


When comparing data with several data, simple difference from the mean would not tell you much. In statistics, two significant features in dataset, mean and standard diviation will tell us clear information about the new data compared to the dataset. In order to clearly show the two features, using the Z score would be the best option assuming that the dataset follow the normal distribution.
